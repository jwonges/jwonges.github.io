    <main>
        <p>I was born in 1997 in <a href ="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/java/surabaya">Surabaya</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia">Indonesia</a>, into a family that represents a melting pot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Indonesia">diverse Indonesian cultures</a>. As a result, I can speak and/or understand several local languages, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language">Javanese</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorontalo%E2%80%93Mongondow_languages">Gorontalo</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larantuka_Malay">Larantuka</a>. This rich cultural background sparked my passion for language learning and my curiosity about different cultures internationally. Currently, I am learning Chinese to connect with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Indonesians">my roots</a> and French for fun.</p>
        <p>In 2015, I moved to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany">Germany</a> to pursue higher education. Since then, I have lived in <a href="https://www.schwaebischhall.de/en/welcome/welcome">Schwäbisch Hall</a>, <a href="https://www.muenchen.de/en/home">Munich</a>, <a href="https://halle.de/">Halle (Saale)</a>, and currently reside in <a href="https://www.visitduesseldorf.de/en">Düsseldorf</a>. Learning German and adapting to a new culture was certainly challenging, but with persistence and the unwavering support of family and friends, I have successfully built a life here.</p>
        <p>To balance things out, I also enjoy creative activities such as drawing, singing, playing the guitar and gaming in my spare time. </p>
